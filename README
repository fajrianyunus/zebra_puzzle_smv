Requirement:
NuSMV

This is solution to the classic Zebra Puzzle (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle) done by using NuSMV.

To execute the NuSMV code, in your command line, just execute:
<nusmv command> <nusmv code>

For example, in my case, it is:
NuSMV solution.smv

You can also see my execution result at solution.txt file. To generate solution.txt, I executed:
NuSMV solution.smv > solution.txt
